But at the same time, it is possible that they have seen a UFO and didn’t have the proper methods to report such a sighting.\nOn the other hand, people in larger cities may not be able to clearly view these supposed “UFO sightings” due to air pollution and sky-scrapers being more prevalent in these areas. But contrary to people in smaller cities, they may have the means to report the sightings quickly.\nWe believe that although this would introduce bad data in the data-set, there isn’t a suitable solution to address this issue. But the shapes column in the ufo_sightings data-set can be a good way to filter out the data-sets, regardless of the location of the sightings.\nShapes that are more commonly sighted will be more likely to actually be true, versus shapes that have one-off or just a few sightings.\nFor example, the “cube” shape has only been sighted twice, which is improbable that it may be sighted correctly, because otherwise we would have seen more sightings of that shape in our data-set. On the other hand, the circle shape appears to be very likely as it has been sighted over 9000 times.\nFurthermore, in order to establish a correlation between UFO shapes and locations, we plan to run a chi-squared test that can quantify the strength and significance of these relationships."

All the data that might not be necessary for our workflow will be removed. We will also be adding and modifying data to the datasets that we have received from the TidyTuesday.\nOur first step with tackling the first question is to use the cleaned data to plot a heatmap of the world.\nWe will group the data of the countries to find the number of sightings in each of the countries.\nThen, we will use the ggmap package of R to plot a heatmap of the world with this data.\nFrom there, we will work on zoning in on the United States. Figuring out those cities where these sightings are prevalent. This will be done using ggplot’s geom_point feature, and the longitude and latitude columns. We will paste this plot over a realistic map of the United States, marking the cities where the density of the sightings are more prevalent.\nThen, we will visualize whether certain areas are more likely to report a certain shape. This will be done with a histogram, comparing the densities of the shapes for the states.\n\nQ.2) Are there any patterns to the sightings concerning seasons? Do astronomical events affect the reported sightings?\n\nFirst, we will slice the reported_date_time_utc column in the ufo_sightingsdataset, and separate the dates and times from it.\nThen we will clean data to handle all the various time zones and merge them accurately, which we have explained below.\nAlongside this, we will work on grouping the dates, by their seasons (i.e. spring, summer, fall, winter)\nUsing this data, we will plot a line chart to visualize the time series analysis of the seasonal data.\nFor the plot to visualize whether astronomical events affect the sightings, we are going to be using a sunburst plot, which will be a part of the sunburstR package.\n\nParameters used\n\nufo_sightings\n\nreported_date_time_utc\ncity\nstate\ncountry_code\nshape\n\nplaces\n\nlatitude\nlongitude\npopulation\nelevation\nstate\ntimezone\n\nday_parts_map\n\nAll columns other than rounded_lat and rounded_long"

    "text": "Question-1\nWhat is the geographic distribution of UFO sightings? Are there any hotspots where the number of sightings is prevalent? Is there any correlation between the location of the sighting and the shape of the UFO?\n\nIntroduction\nEmbarking on a quest to uncover the geographic footprint of UFO sightings, we delved into the data to unveil patterns and hotspots of extraterrestrial encounters. Our journey traversed through spatial landscapes, painting a rich tapestry of sightings across regions. Along the way, we sought to discern any correlations between sighting locations and the enigmatic shapes of UFOs, navigating through the mysteries of the cosmos with data as our compass.\n\n\nApproach\n\nHeatmap Distribution of UFO Sightings: The approach begins by aggregating UFO sighting data by country to understand the geographic distribution. This data is then visualized using a heatmap overlay on a world map, with color intensity representing sighting density. By leveraging ggplot and map_data functions, the visualization highlights regions with higher concentrations of sightings, providing a global perspective.\nUFO Sighting Distribution Around the World: For a closer examination, the analysis zooms in on the United States to identify hotspots of UFO activity. Leveraging the leaflet package, latitude and longitude coordinates of sightings are plotted on an interactive map, allowing users to explore sightings in specific locations. This approach offers a detailed view of sighting prevalence across different states.\nVariance of Shape Sightings: To understand the diversity of reported UFO shapes, the approach filters out less common shapes and creates a bar plot to visualize the frequency of each shape. By focusing on shapes with higher sighting counts, this analysis reveals which shapes are most frequently reported by witnesses, offering insights into popular UFO descriptions.\nTime-series Plot by Season: Exploring potential seasonal patterns, the approach categorizes sightings by season and plots the number of sightings over decades. Using emojis to represent seasons adds a human touch to the visualization, making it more engaging. This analysis aims to uncover any recurring patterns or fluctuations in sightings across different seasons over time.\n\n\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| output: FALSE\n#| code-fold: true\n\nworld_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\ncolnames(world_map)[5] &lt;- \"country\"\n\n\n\nCode\ncolor_scale_values = c(\"&lt;1\" = \"#D8FAFD\", \n                       \"1-29\" = \"#8FFAFD\", \n                       \"30-59\" = \"#0CFDF3\", \n                       \"60-149\" = \"#3282F6\", \n                       \"150-299\" = \"#0023F5\", \n                       \"300-999\" = \"#00129A\", \n                       \"1000+\" = \"#000C7B\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_polygon(data = heatmap_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = sighting_count_range), color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values =  color_scale_values) +\n  coord_fixed(1.3) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUFO Sighting Distribution Around the World\n\n\nCode\nus_places_data &lt;- places |&gt;\n  select(state, country, country_code, latitude, longitude)\nus_places_data &lt;- us_places_data |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(latitude) & !is.na(longitude))\nus_places_data &lt;- us_places_data |&gt;\n  filter(country_code == \"US\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmap_plot &lt;- leaflet(data = us_places_data) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  setView(\n    lng = -115,    # Adjusted center longitude for the entire US\n    lat = 37,      # Adjusted center latitude for the entire US\n    zoom = 3       # Adjusted zoom level\n  )\n\n\nmap_plot &lt;- map_plot |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(lat = ~latitude, lng = ~longitude, color = \"#51EE00\", stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.8)\n\nmap_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariance of Shape Sightings\n\n\nCode\nshapes_filtered &lt;- ufo_sightings |&gt;\n  select(city, state, country_code, shape) |&gt;\n  filter(shape != \"other\" & shape != \"unknown\")\n\n\nshapes_filtered &lt;- shapes_filtered |&gt;\n  group_by(shape) |&gt;\n  filter(dplyr::n() &gt;

    "text": "Question-1: What is the geographic distribution of UFO sightings? Are there any hotspots where the number of sightings is prevalent? Is there any correlation between the location of the sighting and the shape of the UFO?\n\nIntroduction\nFor the first question, we wanted to visualize the geographic distribution of the sightings across the world. UFOs are reportedly sighted all over the world, and this has fascinated researchers with the possibility of finding any patterns or correlations to these sightings.\nIn the second part of this question, we analyze the different shapes that were observed when these sightings were reported. We believe that if there were more reported sightings of a certain shape, there is a likelihood that these shapes could possibly correlate to a UFO sighting.\n\n\nApproach\n\ni. Heat-map distribution of UFO sightings across the World\nOur first step with tackling this problem is to input all the datasets, which is done using the read.csv function of R. From there we select the columns that we need from the places.csv file, which are - state, country, latitude, longitude. The countries are then grouped to find the number of sightings in each one of them, then using the maps package, we form a dataset that can be used to plot the outline of the world map. The countries from our UFO sightings dataset is then left joined onto the world_map dataset. Then, the count of these sightings are grouped into various ranges and these ranges are mapped to a certain shade of blue. Then, using geom_polygon the plot is formed with the colors shading the countries based on the density of the UFO sightings there.\n\n\nCode\n  places_location_data &lt;- places |&gt;\n  select(state, country, latitude, longitude)\n  \n  places_location_data &lt;- places_location_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(country) %&gt;%  summarise(sighting_count = n()) %&gt;%  ungroup()\n\n\n\nworld_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\ncolnames(world_map)[5] &lt;- \"country\"\n\n\nplaces_location_data$country &lt;- tolower(places_location_data$country)\nworld_map$country &lt;- tolower(world_map$country)\n\n\nheatmap_data &lt;- left_join(world_map, places_location_data, by = \"country\")\n\nsetDT(heatmap_data)\n\nheatmap_data[is.na(sighting_count), sighting_count := 0]\n\nheatmap_data[, sighting_count_range := case_when(sighting_count == 0 ~ \"&lt;1\",\n                                                 sighting_count &lt; 30 ~ \"1-29\",\n                                                 sighting_count &lt; 60 ~ \"30-59\",\n                                                 sighting_count &lt; 150 ~ \"60-149\",\n                                                 sighting_count &lt; 200 ~ \"150-299\",\n                                                 sighting_count &lt; 1000 ~ \"300-999\",\n                                                 sighting_count &gt; 1000 ~ \"1000+\",\n                                                 TRUE ~ \"-1\")]\nheatmap_data$sighting_count_range &lt;- factor(heatmap_data$sighting_count_range,\n                                            levels = c(\"&lt;1\",\"1-29\",\"30-59\",\"60-149\",\"150-299\",\"300-999\",\"1000+\"))\n\n\n\ncolor_scale_values = c(\"&lt;1\" = \"#D8FAFD\", \n                       \"1-29\" = \"#8FFAFD\", \n                       \"30-59\" = \"#0CFDF3\", \n                       \"60-149\" = \"#3282F6\", \n                       \"150-299\" = \"#0023F5\", \n                       \"300-999\" = \"#00129A\", \n                       \"1000+\" = \"#000C7B\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_polygon(data = heatmap_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = sighting_count_range), color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values =  color_scale_values) +\n  coord_fixed(1.3)+\n  xlab(\"Longitude\") +\n  ylab(\"Latitude\") +\n  labs(fill = \"Number of sightings by country\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nii. UFO Sighting Distribution Around the World\nFrom the above plot we can find out that the United States has the highest density of UFO sightings in the world. Therefore, we decided to zone-in on the US and find the exact locations where these sightings were observed. This was done using the latitude and longitude data available in the places table. An interactive map was plotted using leaflet which allowed us to zoom in on the various locations where the sightings were observed. Circular green markers were added to indicate these locations with the attribute of leaflet called, addCircleMarkers.\n\n\nCode\nus_places_data &lt;- places |&gt;\n  select(state, country, country_code, latitude, longitude)\nus_places_data &lt;- us_places_data |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(latitude) & !is.na(longitude))\nus_places_data &lt;- us_places_data |&gt;\n  filter(country_code == \"US\")\n\nmap_plot &lt;- leaflet(data = us_places_data) |&gt;\n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  setView(\n    lng = -115,   \n    lat = 37,      \n    zoom = 3      \n  )\n\nmap_plot &lt;- map_plot |&gt;\n  addCircleMarkers(lat = ~latitude, lng = ~longitude, color = \"#51EE00\", stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.8)\n\nmap_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niii. Variance of Shape Sightings\nThe first step in plotting the variance in the shapes, involved cleaning the dataset. We first filtered out all shapes that were reported as other or unknown as we believe plotting these categories wouldn’t be of any use. Then, we filtered out all the shapes, where the total number of reported sightings were less than 1500. We believe these to be negligent compared to the other sightings and could therefore be eliminated. After that, we find the count of each shape and then, a circular bar plot is plotted using ggplot and geom_bar.\n\n\nCode\nshapes_filtered &lt;- ufo_sightings |&gt;\n  select(city, state, country_code, shape) |&gt;\n  filter(shape != \"other\" & shape != \"unknown\")\n\n\nshapes_filtered &lt;- shapes_filtered |&gt;\n  group_by(shape) |&gt;\n  filter(dplyr::n() &gt; 1500) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nshape_counts &lt;- shapes_filtered |&gt;\n  count(shape)\n\n\nggplot(shape_counts, aes(x = n, y = shape)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill=alpha(\"#0023F5\", 0.5)) +\n  xlim(-2000, 19000) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nFrom the first plot we can find out the countries where the number of sightings were higher, indicated by the darker shades of blue versus, countries where the number of sightings were lower, indicated by the lighter shades of blue. We notice that countries where the population is higher or where the infrastructure supports these reportings are shaded darker in color, for example the US, Canada, Australia, India and other countries in Europe. Noticing this, we chose to focus on the United States.\nIn the second plot, we zoned in on the US. We plotted all the individual sightings in the country, and noticed a trend in the data. The sightings are concentrated around the bigger cities, particularly Los Angeles. We all know the city to be the center of Hollywood, we believe that this might play a part in the higher concentration of sightings over there. The influence of sci-fi movies might push the agenda of reported sightings, and although we can not prove whether Hollywood has anything to do with the concentration in UFO sightings in California, it is something that we need to consider as a possibility in the vast number of sightings in the area.\nFor the third plot, we can clearly see that people have reported a “light” as the shape of their sighting the most. After that, triangle, circle and fireball take preference. With so many people reporting similar shapes, we need to take into consideration that there is a reasoning behind this. We don’t usually see triangular or circular objects floating in the sky and the fact that there were multiple people reporting them indicates that there might have been some proof behind it.\n\n\nCode\n# Time-series plot by season (Usama)\n\nufo_sightings &lt;- left_join(ufo_sightings, places, by = c(\"city\", \n                                                         \"state\",\n                                                         \"country_code\"))\n\nufo_sightings &lt;- ufo_sightings |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(shape) & shape != \"other\" & shape != \"unknown\")\n\nufo_sightings$decade &lt;- as.integer(format(ufo_sightings$reported_date_time_utc, \"%Y\")) - as.integer(format(ufo_sightings$reported_date_time_utc, \"%Y\")) %% 10\n\nufo_sightings$reported_date &lt;- as.Date(ufo_sightings$reported_date_time, format=\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\")\n\nget_season &lt;- function(date) {\n  year &lt;- format(date, \"%Y\")\n  start_spring &lt;- as.Date(paste(year, \"-03-21\", sep=\"\"))\n  start_summer &lt;- as.Date(paste(year, \"-06-21\", sep=\"\"))\n  start_autumn &lt;- as.Date(paste(year, \"-09-23\", sep=\"\"))\n  start_winter &lt;- as.Date(paste(year, \"-12-21\", sep=\"\"))\n  \n  if (date &gt;= start_spring & date &lt; start_summer) {\n    return('spring')\n  } else if (date &gt;= start_summer & date &lt; start_autumn) {\n    return('summer')\n  } else if (date &gt;= start_autumn & date &lt; start_winter) {\n    return('autumn')\n  } else {\n    return('winter')\n  }\n}\n\nufo_sightings$season &lt;- sapply(ufo_sightings$reported_date, get_season)\n\nufo_sightings$season_emoji &lt;- case_when(\n      ufo_sightings$season == \"winter\" ~ \"❄️\",\n      ufo_sightings$season == \"spring\" ~ \"⛅️️\",\n      ufo_sightings$season == \"summer\" ~ \"☀️\",\n      ufo_sightings$season == \"autumn\"   ~ \"☂️\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Null\")\n\ngrouped_data &lt;- ufo_sightings |&gt;\n  group_by(decade,season,season_emoji) |&gt;\n  summarise(sightings = n())\n\nimage &lt;- readPNG(here(\"images\",\"ufo_background_image.png\"))\n\n\nggplot(grouped_data, aes(x=decade, y=sightings, color=season)) +\n  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(image),\n                    xmin=-Inf,\n                    xmax=Inf,\n                    ymin=-Inf,\n                    ymax=Inf) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.8) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = season_emoji)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,14000,2000)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1920,2020,10)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title=\"UFO sightings by season over years\",\n       x=\"Decade\",\n       y=\"Number of Sightings\",\n       subtitle = \"Sightings by each decade from 1920 till 2020\",\n       color = \"Season\") +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"black\",\n                                          linewidth = 0.5,\n                                          linetype = \"dotted\"),\n        panel.background = element_blank(), \n        panel.ontop = TRUE)"

    "text": "Question-2: Are there any patterns to the sightings concerning seasons? Do astronomical events affect the reported sightings?\n\nIntroduction\nFor the second question, we aimed to analyze any prevalent historical trends in the UFO sightings and justify the occurrence of those trends, if any. We divided this question into two segments. For the first segment, we wanted to visualize any historical trends in the number of UFO sightings and for the second segment, we adopted a more granular approach and visualized the number of sightings by different parts of the day i.e. dusk, dawn etc. Finally, we correlated our visualizations with any other historical trends that occurred during the same time-frame.\n\n\nApproach\ni. Time-series Visualization of UFO Sightings\nTo adopt a more generalized approach, we wanted to convert the data into decades from years. To this end, we joined the UFO sightings data with places by city, state, and country_code. We then filtered the sightings by shape, removing any NULL or undefined values. Afterwards, we mutated the seasons column and then summarized the sightings count by decade and season. Finally, we plotted the data using geom_line and added a few aesthetics to make the plot look more pleasing.\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode\n# Ufo sightings by part of the day (Naitik)\n\nsetDT(ufo_sightings)\ndf &lt;- ufo_sightings[, .(sightings = .N), day_part]\nView(df)\n\ndf &lt;- na.omit(df) # Omiting the NA values from the df\n\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"night\",\"Night\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"nautical dusk\",\"Nautical Dusk\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"afternoon\",\"Afternoon\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"morning\",\"Morning\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"astronomical dusk\",\"Astronomical Dusk\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"civil dusk\",\"Civil Dusk\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"civil dawn\",\"Civil Dawn\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"nautical dawn\",\"Nautical Dawn\",df$day_part)\ndf$day_part &lt;- gsub(\"astronomical dawn\",\"Astronomical Dawn\",df$day_part)\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x=reorder(day_part, sightings), y=sightings, fill=day_part)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"UFO Sightings by Part of the Day\",\n       x=\"Part of the Day\",\n       y=\"Number of Sightings\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nii. UFO Sightings by part of the day:\nUsing the joined dataset from last part, we calculated the number of sightings by astronomical events by day_part column. By this point, most of the data was already pre-processed therefore we only removed any missing or NA values from the day_part column. Afterwards, we standardized the naming convention and used geom_bar to make a histogram of count against astronomical events.\n\n\nAnalysis\nFor the first plot, we saw some intriguing trends. The sighting up until 1980 remained less than 1000. Post 1990, the number of sightings started to increase and reached its peak in 2010. At this moment, we cannot draw any conclusions for the most recent decade (2020) because we do not have 7 years worth of data (2024 till 2030) and the data has not matured yet. By seasons, we saw that most number of sightings took place during summers.\nThere can be several reasons for this trend like improved technology for sightings, a population boost hence increasing the number of sightings per capita etc but we shortlisted the inclusion of internet into the picture as the most important one. With internet, UFOs and alien life has become one of the most debated topics across the world and people are more likely to share their experiences and sightings online, leading to a heightened awareness and reporting of UFO sightings. Additionally, the internet also provides a platform for the dissemination of information and the formation of online communities like Reddit groups dedicated to discussing UFO phenomena, further amplifying interest and contributing to the observed increase in reported sightings.\nFor maximum sightings during summer, the season’s extended daylight, clearer skies, and heightened outdoor activity contribute to its status as a prime season for UFO sightings, forecasting increased attention and reporting of aerial phenomenon during this time.\nFor the second plot, we saw that most number of UFO sightings (&gt; 80%) took place during night time, while the least number of UFO sightings took place during civil dawn.\nSeveral reasons can be attributed to this phenomenon. Nighttime offers ideal conditions for observing celestial phenomenon, with reduced ambient light and and decreased human activity allowing for clearer visibility of the sky. Moreover, the darkness of night often evokes a sense mystery and intrigue, prompting individuals to be more vigilant."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nKarl Sagan once tried to address the question of whether aliens exist in terms of probability. He explained that given the infinitely many exoplanets in our universe, the mathematical probability of alien life existing on at least one of those planets is not 0. However,despite this mathematical possibility, the question of whether aliens exist remains unanswered due to the lack of conclusive evidence in our analysis. For every observed trend, there exists a possible explanation.\nOngoing scientific research and exploration, including the search for microbial life on other planets, continues to fuel speculation and curiosity surrounding the existence of aliens. Ultimately, the question remains one of the most intriguing and unresolved mysteries in science."
